## Instructions
Download the pre-trained weights for [ActionCLIP](https://github.com/sallymmx/ActionCLIP). You can refer to the environment configuration in the [ActionCLIP](https://github.com/sallymmx/ActionCLIP) project to set up the Python environment.

## Download the Dataset
Download the dataset according to the video data addresses listed in the lists folder. For example, for the HRI10 dataset, the link is [HRI10](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TQSwGIQlfo1-Uu44JJ0K6IZn67gXPu8n?usp=drive_link).

## Generate Few-Shot Data
Run 
```
python encode_dataset.py
``` 
script to generate few-shot data.

## Generate Text Features
Run 
```
python generate_text_classifier_weights.py
``` 
 script to generate text features.

## Test Zero-Shot Recognition
Run 
```
python run_zs_baseline.py
``` 
script to test the zero-shot recognition performance.

## Test the Improved TIP-Adapter Method
Run 
```
python tip_adaper.py
``` 
script to test the improved TIP-Adapter method for construction activity recognition.

## Test the Improved TIP-X Method
Run 
```
python tipx.py
```
script to test the improved TIP-X method for construction activity recognition.

## Test the Proposed Method
Run 
```
python tipx-feed.py
```
script to test the proposed method for construction activity recognition.
